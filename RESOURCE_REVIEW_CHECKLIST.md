## Review Notes

### Issues Identified
<!-- Add notes about specific issues found during reviews -->
- **Memberships**: Field discovery endpoints `/memberships/search/searchFields` and `/memberships/search/outputFields` return HTTP 404 - resource doesn't support field discovery

### Issues Fixed
- **Validation System**: Fixed field type detection to use actual API operator data instead of guessing field types from static mappings
- **Base Resource Error Handling**: Added proper NotImplementedError handling for resources that don't support field discovery
- **Search Examples**: Fixed notebook examples to use correct field names and proper generator handling
- **Operator Validation**: Now uses real operator lists from API instead of static field type assumptions

### Completed Reviews
<!-- Add notes about successfully completed reviews -->
- **Accounts**: Read-only review completed - field discovery working, search examples fixed and tested
- **Activities**: Read-only review completed - field discovery verified working
- **Donations**: Read-only review completed - field discovery working, validation system fixed to use API operator data, search examples working
- **Events**: Read-only review completed - field discovery verified working

### Next Steps
1. Start with core resources (Accounts, Donations, Events)
2. Focus on read-only reviews first for stability
3. Progress to CRUD operations after read-only is stable
4. Validate all tests last to ensure comprehensive coverage
