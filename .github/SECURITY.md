## Security Best Practices

When using the Neon CRM SDK:

### API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the principle of least privilege

### Environment Configuration
- Always use the `trial` environment for development and testing
- Only use `production` environment for live applications
- Validate environment configuration before API calls

### Error Handling
- Don't log sensitive information in error messages
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Use the SDK's built-in exception handling

### Dependencies
- Keep the SDK updated to the latest version
- Regularly audit and update dependencies
- Use tools like `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities

### Example Secure Configuration

```python
import os
from neon_crm import NeonClient

# Secure way to initialize the client
client = NeonClient(
    org_id=os.getenv("NEON_ORG_ID"),
    api_key=os.getenv("NEON_API_KEY"),
    environment=os.getenv("NEON_ENVIRONMENT", "trial")
)

# Validate configuration
if not client.org_id or not client.api_key:
    raise ValueError("Missing required Neon CRM credentials")
```

## Security Features

The Neon CRM SDK includes several security features:

- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated using Pydantic models
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints prevent common programming errors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in handling of API rate limits
- **TLS Encryption**: All API communications use HTTPS

## Security Scanning

This project uses automated security scanning:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Scanning**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of container images
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of accidentally committed secrets

## Compliance

The Neon CRM SDK is designed to help users maintain compliance with:

- Data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Industry standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- API security best practices (OWASP API Security Top 10)
