# Migration Analysis CSV Report - Interpretation Guide

## Overview
The `simple_migration_analysis_TIMESTAMP.csv` file contains a comprehensive analysis of accounts that need V-field migration. This report shows the current state of data and what actions are required for each field migration.

## CSV Column Definitions

### Core Identity Columns
- **Account_ID**: The unique identifier for each account in Neon CRM
- **Migration_Ready**: `True` if the account can be migrated without conflicts, `False` if there are issues to resolve
- **Total_Actions**: Number of migration actions needed for this account
- **Conflicts**: Number of conflicts that need manual resolution

### Field Data Columns
- **Source_Field**: The original V-field name (e.g., "V-Canvassing", "V-Data Entry")
- **Target_Field**: The destination field where data should be migrated (e.g., "V-Volunteer Campaign & Election Activities")
- **Source_Value**: Current value in the source V-field (what needs to be migrated)
- **Target_Value**: Current value in the target field (what's already there)
- **Expected_Option**: For multi-select fields, the specific option that should be added to the target field

### Action Planning Column
- **Action_Required**: What needs to happen during migration:
  - `MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP`: Move source value to target field, then clear source field
  - `CLEANUP_ONLY`: Target already has correct data, only need to clear source field
  - `CONFLICT`: Source and target have different values - needs manual review
  - `NO_ACTION`: No data in source field, nothing to do

## Understanding the Action Types

### ✅ CLEANUP_ONLY
**What it means**: The target field already contains the correct data
**Example**:
- Source: "V-Volunteer Form Other Comments" = "I love volunteering"
- Target: "V-Volunteer Form Other Comments" = "I love volunteering"
- Action: Just clear the source field since target is already correct

### ⚠️ MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP
**What it means**: Need to move data from source to target, then clean up source
**Example**:
- Source: "V-Canvassing" = "Yes"
- Target: "V-Volunteer Campaign & Election Activities" = (empty or doesn't contain "Canvassing/literature Drop")
- Action: Add "Canvassing/literature Drop" option to target field, then clear source

### ❌ CONFLICT
**What it means**: Source and target have different values - manual decision needed
**Example**:
- Source: "V-Volunteer Form Other Comments" = "I prefer evening shifts"
- Target: "V-Volunteer Form Other Comments" = "I prefer morning shifts"
- Action: Human needs to decide which value to keep or how to combine them

### ⭕ NO_ACTION
**What it means**: Source field is empty, nothing to migrate
**Example**:
- Source: "V-Canvassing" = (empty)
- Action: Skip this field

## How to Use This Report for Migration Planning

### Step 1: Review Conflict Summary
1. Filter for `Action_Required = CONFLICT`
2. These require manual review before migration
3. Decide for each conflict:
   - Keep source value (overwrite target)
   - Keep target value (ignore source)
   - Combine both values

### Step 2: Validate CLEANUP_ONLY Actions
1. Filter for `Action_Required = CLEANUP_ONLY`
2. Verify that source and target values are truly equivalent
3. These are safe to process automatically

### Step 3: Plan MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP Actions
1. Filter for `Action_Required = MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP`
2. For multi-select fields, verify the `Expected_Option` is correct
3. These will add new data to target fields

### Step 4: Execution Planning
**Safe to automate**:
- All `CLEANUP_ONLY` actions
- Most `MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP` actions (after validation)

**Require manual review**:
- All `CONFLICT` actions
- Any `MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP` where Expected_Option seems wrong

## Sample Data Interpretation

```csv
Account_ID,Migration_Ready,Total_Actions,Conflicts,Source_Field,Target_Field,Source_Value,Target_Value,Expected_Option,Action_Required
6488,True,2,0,V-Volunteer Form Other Comments,V-Volunteer Form Other Comments,I know AI because I am AI,I know AI because I am AI,,CLEANUP_ONLY
6488,True,2,0,V-Canvassing,V-Volunteer Campaign & Election Activities,Yes,,Canvassing/literature Drop,MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP
```

### Interpretation:
- **Account 6488** has 2 actions needed, no conflicts
- **Row 1**: Comments field already matches - just need to clear source
- **Row 2**: Need to add "Canvassing/literature Drop" option to campaign activities field, then clear V-Canvassing

## Migration Execution Order

1. **Handle Conflicts First**: Resolve all `CONFLICT` actions manually
2. **Execute Migrations**: Process `MIGRATE_AND_CLEANUP` actions
3. **Final Cleanup**: Process `CLEANUP_ONLY` actions to clear source fields

## Quality Checks

### Before Migration:
- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Expected options validated for multi-select fields
- [ ] Backup of data completed

### After Migration:
- [ ] Source fields cleared successfully
- [ ] Target fields contain expected data
- [ ] No data loss occurred
- [ ] Run analysis again to verify completion

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Select Field Migrations
- Source: Single checkbox field (e.g., "V-Canvassing")
- Target: Multi-select field with many options
- Action: Add specific option to target field's list

### Direct Field Copies
- Source: Text field (e.g., "V-Volunteer Form Other Comments")
- Target: Same field name
- Action: Copy value directly, then clear source

### Field Consolidations
- Multiple source fields → Single target field
- Requires careful option mapping
- May need multiple Expected_Options per target

## Troubleshooting

**Empty CSV or No Data**:
- All V-fields may already be cleaned up
- Check if search criteria need adjustment
- Verify field names are correct

**Many Conflicts**:
- Review field mapping configuration
- Consider if source/target field pairing is correct
- May indicate incomplete previous migration

**Unexpected Action Types**:
- Verify field types (text vs. multi-select)
- Check if custom field options changed
- Review mapping configuration
